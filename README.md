# Custom Movie Recommendation Website

## Project Overview
This project delivers a personalized movie recommendation website powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini AI and OMDb. Users can enter their favorite movies (or upload a simple list) and receive tailored suggestions along with visual explanations. The interface displays word clouds, interactive recommendation cards, and lets users manage personal watchlists‚Äîall within a responsive, engaging UI. üòä

**Objectives:**
- Generate personalized movie recommendations based on user-provided titles.
- Leverage Gemini AI‚Äôs language reasoning to analyze common themes and styles.
- Present recommendations in an intuitive, interactive interface with visual insights.
- Allow users to maintain personal movie lists (watchlist / ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù).
- Prepare the architecture for future enhancements (file uploads, authentication, music integration).

**Scope & Boundaries:**
- Focus on single-user interaction (no multi-account system in v1).
- Support direct movie-title input (three titles) for recommendations.
- No user authentication or social sharing in the initial release.
- Basic persistence via localStorage; database integration is planned later.
